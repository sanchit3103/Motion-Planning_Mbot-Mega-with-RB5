# Motion Planning of Mbot Mega Robot on Qualcomm RB5 Platform

<p align="justify">
This project focuses on implementation of search based path planning algorithm with PID control system on Mbot Mega robot powered using Qualcomm RB5 platform to enable the robot to reach the target position following the shortest path. The project further address two specific requirements about the nature of the path traversed in terms of distance optimality and maximum safety.
