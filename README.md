# Motion Planning of Mbot Mega Robot on Qualcomm RB5 Platform

<p align="justify">
This project focuses on implementation of search based path planning algorithm with PID control system on Mbot Mega robot powered using Qualcomm RB5 platform. The goal of the project is to enable the robot reach the target position following a shortest path in a 10ft ×10ft area with visual feedback from April tag landmarks. The project further address two specific requirements about the nature of the path traversed in terms of distance optimality and maximum safety.
